# Bay-Area-Real-Estate


In this project, I am exploring the Bay Area real estate price cycles across value groups - recognized by counties - by utilizing some time series approaches on the available historical data of Median Single-Family Homes Across the Bay Area, California.

I also applied ARIMA and SARIMA algorithms on the monthly median price of single-family houses after the financial crisis. I built predictive models with an average of 4.66% RMSE across counties in the Bay Area, California. 

The dataset is acquired through the “California Association of Realtors” platform (https://car.sharefile.com/share/view/s0c02663a5c54e23a). This dataset originally contains the county single-family home sales data, generated from a survey of more than 90 associations of realtors throughout the state. Sample data has been refined and modified to increase the accuracy of the statistics; The dataset has a monthly median price of existing single-family homes in all counties of California starting from January 1990 to March 2021.
