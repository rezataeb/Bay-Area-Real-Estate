# Bay-Area-Real-Estate


In this project, I am exploring the Bay Area real estate price cycles across value groups - recognized by counties - by utilizing some time series approaches on the available historical data of Median Single-Family Homes Across the Bay Area, California.

I also applied ARIMA and SARIMA algorithms on the monthly median price of single-family houses after the financial crisis. I built predictive models with an average of 4.66% RMSE across counties in the Bay Area, California.
